Here is an example of a PRD for a hypothetical project:

Product Requirements Document

Project Name: XYZ App

Project Purpose: The XYZ App is a mobile application that allows users to create and share shopping lists with their friends and family. The app aims to simplify the shopping experience and make it more social.

User Persona: Busy young adults who frequently shop for groceries and household items.

Key Features:

Ability to share shopping lists via social media and email
Smart suggestions for products based on user history and preferences
Personalized product recommendations based on current list contents
User Experience: The XYZ App will have a simple and intuitive user interface that allows users to quickly create and manage shopping lists. Users will be able to easily share their lists with others, track changes made by collaborators, and communicate with them in-app. The app will provide personalized recommendations to help users find the products they need.

Use Cases:

The app will use machine learning algorithms to provide personalized recommendations.
Success Metrics:

User engagement: daily active users, average session length, number of shopping lists created and shared.
User retention: percentage of users who return to the app within 30 days.
User satisfaction: app store ratings and reviews, user surveys.
Mockups:

See attached mockups for visual representation of the app.

Review and Iteration:

The PRD will be reviewed by the development team, project stakeholders, and potential users. Feedback will be used to iterate on the PRD until a final version is agreed upon.
